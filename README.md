This case study dives into the challenges and solutions
associated with building a high-performance E-commerce Sales Transaction system for Jiggy
E-commerce. By employing Python for data manipulation, SQL for data querying, and PostgreSQL as
the underlying database, the aim is to construct a system that stands at the forefront of efficiency,
scalability, and reliability. The ultimate vision is to transform Jiggy E-commerce into a data-savvy
enterprise, where every transaction is an opportunity for optimization and customer delight.


BUSINESS PROBLEM STATEMENT
● As Jiggy E-commerce embarks on a journey of rapid growth and expansion, its existing infrastructure
for managing sales transactions has been pushed to its limits. The company is grappling with several
critical issues:
1. Data Integrity and Accuracy: Inconsistent data entry and the lack of a robust validation system
have led to inaccuracies in the transactional records. This undermines trust in the data and
hampers the ability to make informed decisions.
2. Scalability Concerns: With an increasing number of transactions, the current system fails to scale
efficiently. This results in slower processing times, delayed reporting, and an inability to handle
peak loads, affecting both operational effectiveness and customer satisfaction.
3. Customer Experience: At the heart of these technical challenges lies the impact on the customer
experience. Issues such as order delays, inaccurate product information, and a lack of
personalized recommendations have led to customer dissatisfaction and eroded loyalty.
The need for a data engineering solution that addresses these challenges head-on is clear. By leveraging
advanced technologies and methodologies, the goal is to build a system that not only resolves the current
issues but also sets a foundation for future innovation and growth within Jiggy E-commerce.

TECH STACKS
In addressing the multifaceted challenges of Jiggy E-commerce, our chosen tech stack comprises Python,
SQL, and PostgreSQL Server. This combination offers a powerful, flexible, and efficient solution for
managing, analyzing, and leveraging large volumes of e-commerce sales transaction data.
● Python: Renowned for its simplicity and versatility, Python serves as the cornerstone for data
manipulation and analysis tasks. With libraries such as Pandas for data processing and SQLAlchemy
for database connection, Python facilitates seamless interaction with the database and enables the
implementation of complex data engineering pipelines.
● SQL: Structured Query Language (SQL) is the lingua franca for database management and
manipulation. It allows for the precise querying, updating, and management of data stored in
relational databases. Through SQL, data engineers can perform complex data analysis, generate
reports, and extract insights directly from the database.
● PostgreSQL Server: As an advanced, open-source relational database system, PostgreSQL offers robust
features to ensure data integrity, support complex queries, and handle large datasets efficiently. It's
known for its reliability, data compliance, and scalability, making it an ideal choice for managing the
extensive sales transactions of Jiggy E-commerce.
